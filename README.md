# kickstarter-analysis Challenge
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Challenge
To determine the success of a Kick Starter campaign, for a play, based on the goals and the launch date of the campaign.

# Outcomes based on Goals

Most successful Play Kick Starters set a goal of less than $5,000.  Attaining this goal leads to a success rate of over 70%.  $35,000  to $44,999 has a success rate of over 60%.  Goals of $20,000 to $34,999 and more than $45,000 have a success rate of less than 50%, with $45,000 to $49,999 having a 0% success rate.  I would focus on the lower amount goals as they bring the most success.  Even trying for the $35k to $45k could have you accidentally reaching a goal that is high or lower than the expected amount and could lead to a lower success rate.

# Outcomes based on Launch Date

Theater Kick Starter campaigns that start in May have the most amount of success, so starting in this month would be advantageous and increase your chances of success.  If May is not possible, June and July have the second and third most successful Kick Starter campaigns out of the remaining months.  Months leading up to and following Christmas are the worst months to start a Kick Starter campaign.  People are most likely saving and spending for the holidays and are less likely to spend money on a Kick Starter.

Theater has the most successful campaigns, while also having the most failed.  Success vs. Failed is around 3:2, so there is some risk, but plays do bring the most success, so focusing ont hsi could be beneficial.  This is all contingent on sticking to successful months and raisjng the right amount of money.  Music is only around 30 less outcomes than theater, but over 230 less failures.  A change to Music may bring more success than focusing on theater.
